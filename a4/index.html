              <h1>My life is a jounary</h1>
              <p>I want to decide by myself which route of the journey I will explore instead of letting my parents decide this for me.
                I want to pursue my own dreams instead of the ones my parents had but failed to achieve.
                Being an obedient child and an appendent of my parents for about thirty years, I decided to have a new role,
                which is to be myself and to be my own dream chaser.
              </p>
              <h2>When I was in China</h2>
              <p>After I graduated from the university, my parents wanted me to have a stable and predictable job,
                so I applied for a job at a government agency and became a policeman,
                even though I wanted to be a software engineer.

              <h2>Change my life</h2>
              <p>
                Listening to my heart, I know I would like my life to be filled with more challenges.
                I decided to follow my heart and change my role from a Chinese police officer
                (for which I know what I would be doing in 30 years) into an American student
                (for which it is hard for me to predict what life would be even in 3 years).
                But I am very excited about this new role and think I am going to have an adventure
                which I chose for myself and confront the biggest challenge so far in my life.
